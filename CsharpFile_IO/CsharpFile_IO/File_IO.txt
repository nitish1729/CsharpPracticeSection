A file is collection of data stored in a disk with specific name and directory path.

*Name = abc.txt

Dirctory path => C:\Users\NITISH MEHTA\OneDrive\Desktop\CsharpPracticeSection\CsharpFile_IO\CsharpFile_IO\Program.cs

File Handling allows to store/ retrive data on permanent storage.

File and its data can be handled programmatically.

When a file is opened for reading or writing, it becomes a stream.

The stream is basically the seuence of bytes passing through the communication path.  There are two main streams: the input stream and output stream is used for writing into the files 
(write operation)

The .Net framework provides a few basic classes for creating,reading and writing to files on the secondary storage and for retriving files
system information.


They are located in the system.IO namespace and used both in desktop application and the web applications.


Class used in File Handling in C#
1. FileStream
2. BinaryReader
3.BinaryWriter
4.StreamReader
5.StreamWriter
6.StringWriter
7.StringReader
8.DirectoryInfo.   All these classes are present in System.IO namespace. This namespace is used for performing operations with files.

 Use ReadAllText method of file class to read the data from text.

 Use Copy method of file class to make a copy of a file.

 Copy method have 2 overloaded versions
 * 1st version takes 2 arguments.
 * 2nd version takes 3 arguments.
 1st version of copy method does not allowed to ocerwrite files, if you try to overwrite file then it throws exception.

 2nd version of Copy Method allowed to overwrite files.
 Copies an existing file to a  new file. Overwriting a file of the same name is allowed.
 Overawrite true if the destination file can be overwritten; otherwise, false.


                             Directory Info Class
                 """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
       It is used to create, delete and move directory
       it providees method to perform operations related to directory and subdirectory. It is a sealed class so, we cannot inherit it.
       C# Directory class provides functionality to work with folders or directories

       The Directory class shares almost all of the same properties as the FileInfo class, except that they operate on the directories not files.

       The DirectoryInfo class does have static method and can only be used on the instantiated objects.

       The DirectoryInfo instance methods for deleting folders, creating a new directory and sub directores.


      * Create :- this Method is used to create the new directory.

      * CreateSubDirectory :- This Method is used to create a subdirectory or subdirectory on the specified path;

      * MoveTo :- Moves a DirectoryInfo Insatnce and its contents to a new path.
