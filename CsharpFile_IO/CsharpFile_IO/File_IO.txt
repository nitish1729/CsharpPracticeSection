A file is collection of data stored in a disk with specific name and directory path.

*Name = abc.txt

Dirctory path => C:\Users\NITISH MEHTA\OneDrive\Desktop\CsharpPracticeSection\CsharpFile_IO\CsharpFile_IO\Program.cs

File Handling allows to store/ retrive data on permanent storage.

File and its data can be handled programmatically.

When a file is opened for reading or writing, it becomes a stream.

The stream is basically the seuence of bytes passing through the communication path.  There are two main streams: the input stream and output stream is used for writing into the files 
(write operation)

The .Net framework provides a few basic classes for creating,reading and writing to files on the secondary storage and for retriving files
system information.


They are located in the system.IO namespace and used both in desktop application and the web applications.


Class used in File Handling in C#
1. FileStream
2. BinaryReader
3.BinaryWriter
4.StreamReader
5.StreamWriter
6.StringWriter
7.StringReader
8.DirectoryInfo.   All these classes are present in System.IO namespace. This namespace is used for performing operations with files.

 Use ReadAllText method of file class to read the data from text.

 Use Copy method of file class to make a copy of a file.

 Copy method have 2 overloaded versions
 * 1st version takes 2 arguments.
 * 2nd version takes 3 arguments.
 1st version of copy method does not allowed to ocerwrite files, if you try to overwrite file then it throws exception.

 2nd version of Copy Method allowed to overwrite files.
 Copies an existing file to a  new file. Overwriting a file of the same name is allowed.
 Overawrite true if the destination file can be overwritten; otherwise, false.


                             Directory Info Class
                 """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
       It is used to create, delete and move directory
       it providees method to perform operations related to directory and subdirectory. It is a sealed class so, we cannot inherit it.
       C# Directory class provides functionality to work with folders or directories

       The Directory class shares almost all of the same properties as the FileInfo class, except that they operate on the directories not files.

       The DirectoryInfo class does have static method and can only be used on the instantiated objects.

       The DirectoryInfo instance methods for deleting folders, creating a new directory and sub directores.


      * Create :- this Method is used to create the new directory.

      * CreateSubDirectory :- This Method is used to create a subdirectory or subdirectory on the specified path;

      * MoveTo :- Moves a DirectoryInfo Insatnce and its contents to a new path.

      * Delete :- Delete This instance of a directoryInfo, specifiying whether to delete subdirectory and files.

      * GetDirectory :- This method is used to get the sub Directory in the given directory path;
       
     * GetFiles :- The GetFiles method is used to get the files in the specified folder.

     * Name
     * FullName
     * GetFiles().Length;
     * LastAccessTime;
     * CreationTime;
     * Atributes;
     * Parents;
     * Root;

                                                    File Stream 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
 The FileStream Class represents a file in the Computer;
 Use the FileStream class to read from, write to, open to and close files on a file system;

 The FileStream is a class used for reading and writing files in C#

 FileStream is derived from 

 FileStream class is used to perform the basic operations of reading and writing operting system files.

 FileSteam Class helps in reading from, writing and closing files.

 To manipulate files using FileStream, you need to create an objecyt of filesStream class.

 This objecyt has four parameters; the name of the files, FileMode,FileAccess, and FileShare;


 * FileMode :- It specifies how to operation system should open the file. It has follwing members.

 * Append :- Open the files if exists or create a new files. If files exists then please cursor at the end of the file 

 * Create :- It specifies operations system to create a new file. If File already exist then previous file will be overwritten

 * CreateNew :- it create a new files and if the files already exists then throw IOException.

 * Open :-    Open existing files
 *    Open or create open existing file and not found then create new file.

 * Truncate :- Open an existing file and cull all the stored data. So the file size becomes 0.

 //"""""""""""""""""""""""""""FileStreamWriter"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
 StreamWriter class can be used to write text file.

 StreamWriter class in C# writes characers to a stream in a specified encoding.

 StreamWritter.Write() method is responsible for writing text to a stream

 StreamWriter class in inherited from Textwriter class that provides methods to write an object to a string, write strings to a file, or to serialize XML.

 The StreamWriter class has several constractors and provides us with many methods.

 It is the best places in using statement to ensure that the resourses can be removed when no longer needed.



  //"""""""""""""""""""""""""""FileStreamReader"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

  Streamreader class is used to read string from the stream.

  StreamReader reads text files.

  it inherits Textreader class.

  it provides ReadLine() method to read data from the stream
